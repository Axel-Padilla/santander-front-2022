## You've reached just a practice project

Hi, my name is Axel and this is my work that I developed during the phase 1 of the BEDU's course.

This is a clone of the Matcha's page (just a visual clone, because is my own code), just to put in practice basic knowledge about *HTML* and *CSS* languages,
both are used for web development. You can find topics like:

- Designing of a navbar
- Using of flexbox
- Using of grid
- Using of lots of *CSS* properties
- Using of *CSS* frameworks
- Using of *CSS* preprocessors
- Responsive Design

Feel free to read and take some code from my repo if you need, what better than helping people?

You can take a look in:

* The original page: [https://getmatcha.com/](https://getmatcha.com/)
* My practice replica: [https://marvelous-nasturtium-fcfcf3.netlify.app/](https://marvelous-nasturtium-fcfcf3.netlify.app/)

**Note: My coding is not perfect, I'm kind of a begginer in web development, hehe. The page isn't fisnished yet.**
